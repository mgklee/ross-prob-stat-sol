This document is a solutions manual to accompany <b>Ross, Sheldon M. <i>Introduction to Probability and Statistics for Engineers and Scientists.</i></b> Elsevier, 2014.

All solutions are based on the author's definitions, assuming that all theorems, including lemmas and corollaries, and examples covered in the text can be cited without proof.
If one quotes a proposition introduced in another exercise, see the solution to that problem for proof.

This paper is unofficial and might still contain some errors, although I have worked on minimizing them.
